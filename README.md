This is my project 4, and this project required us to have a csv file that contained many food items and to use algorithms to find the top combination of items that had the highest calories and fit within a certain weight limit. The two algorithms are Dynamic Programming and Exhaustive Search. The dynamic programming requires us to create a DP table and use an algorithm to fill it up, then use traceback to find the top items that fit into the weight requirement. The exhaustive search does find us the best combination of items, but it takes a long time to do it, so we had to use a limited size for the exhaustive search in order to complete it within a reasonable time frame.
